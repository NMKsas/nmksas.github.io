                    <h2 style="text-align:left">Background</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:left">The aim of the Data Structures and Algorithms -course was to learn implementing algorithms and 
                        evaluating performance in programming. To achieve this in practice the course had a programming 
                        project, which recorded information about towns (name, coordinates, collected tax revenue) 
                        and how they were connected (roads and vassalships).</p>
                    <p style="text-align:left">                      
                        As part of the assignment each method had to have an estimate of the asymptotic performance
                        of the operation and a short rational for the estimate. The functionalities of the public 
                        methods were predetermined in project's documentation. Own functions could be implemented 
                        in the private section. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        The project had two different phases; the first phase focused on implementing the data structures
                        and creating methods related to towns' vassalships. The second phase focused on connecting towns
                        with roads and applying several search algorithms in practice. Besides carrying out the 
                        implementations of both phases, student was to write Readme -files for both phases.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="text-align:left">The repository of this project is private.</h3>

                    <p style="text-align:left">Datastructures -class (C++) which was implemented as an assignment is stored 
                        in a private repository. This is to keep the content of Datastructures and Algorithms -course 
                        hidden from public view.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:left">                      
                       The teachers of this course change the assignment for each new course
                       implementation, but the core content stays the same - if any student of the future 
                       implementations was to find my repository, s/he could greatly benefit from it but lose the 
                       unique opportunity to learn by her/himself.
